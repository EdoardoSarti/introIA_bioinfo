    "In this assignment you are going to apply logistic regression methods to analyze a famous dataset on breast cancer prediction<sup>1</sup>: *breast_cancer.tsv*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in western countries. Telling benign and malignant breast cancer apart is thus of paramount importance, yet very challenging: although there are combinations of cellular traits that characterize malignant cancer, there are no simple criteria for discriminating them exactly.\n",
    "**Is there a way to successfully predict whether a skin cancer is benign or malignant?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "The database proposed in this labwork collects 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The last column contains the corresponding diagnosis (benign=0, malignant=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "Our aim is to spatially separate (as much as possible) the distributions of benign and malignant breast cancers, and then fit a logistic regression able to predict if a cancer cell is benign or malign with maximum efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup>This is a copy of [UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets](https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2)."
